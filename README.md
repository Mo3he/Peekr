# Peekr

A native iOS/iPadOS/macOS app for monitoring your self-hosted homelab services. Built with SwiftUI, no external dependencies.

## Features

### Monitoring
- HTTP/HTTPS/TCP health checks with live latency
- 27 built-in integrations with live metrics fetched from each service's API
- Latency sparkline and 30-check history per service
- Uptime percentage over 24h, 7 days, and 30 days
- Status event log across all services

### Services supported
Home Assistant, AdGuard Home, Grafana, Portainer, Jellyfin, Plex, Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, Overseerr, Proxmox, TrueNAS, Traefik, Unifi Controller, Pi-hole, Nextcloud, Vaultwarden, Immich, Paperless-ngx, Frigate, ntfy, qBittorrent, OpenWrt, Glances, Nginx Proxy Manager, GitHub, and Generic (any HTTP endpoint)

### Smart network handling
- Automatically pauses local-only services when you're off your home network
- Uses a concurrent TCP probe, not WiFi SSID (no location permission needed)
- Per-service check intervals (30s to 15 min, independent of the global setting)

### Widgets
- Home screen: small (overall status) and medium (status breakdown)
- Lock screen: circular and rectangular
- Configurable widget: pin any service to a widget and see its live status
- Widget reads from a shared App Group container - always up to date

### Notifications
- Background refresh every 15 minutes
- Offline and recovery alerts per service (toggle per service)
- Time-sensitive interruption level for offline alerts

### Organization
- Group services into custom sections
- Search and filter by status
- Reorder services and metrics by drag

### Platform
- iPhone: tab bar layout
- iPad: three-column NavigationSplitView (services | detail | event log)
- Mac (Catalyst): full app + menu bar status indicator
- Onboarding flow on first launch

### Data
- Credentials stored securely in the system Keychain (never in UserDefaults or iCloud)
- iCloud KV sync for the service list across devices (requires paid Apple Developer account)
- Export services as JSON
- Export uptime report as a self-contained HTML file
- Import services from JSON

### Developer
- Siri Shortcuts integration: "Refresh Peekr", "Is [service] online in Peekr"
- Privacy manifest (PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy) declaring all required-reason API usage
- Export compliance declared (ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = false)

## Requirements

- iOS 17+ / iPadOS 17+ / macOS 14+ (via Catalyst)
- Xcode 16+
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install XcodeGen if you don't have it
brew install xcodegen

# Clone and generate the project
git clone https://github.com/Mo3he/Peekr.git
cd Peekr
xcodegen generate --spec project.yml

# Open in Xcode
open Peekr.xcodeproj
```

Build and run on a simulator or device. The widget extension is the `PeekrWidget` scheme.

## Adding a New Integration

1. Add a case to `ServiceType.swift` with `displayName`, `icon`, `defaultPort`, `authMode`, etc.
2. Create `YourIntegration.swift` in `Services/Integrations/` conforming to `ServiceIntegration`
3. Register it in `IntegrationProvider.integration(for:)` in `ServiceIntegration.swift`
